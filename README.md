Welcome to Snackbowl, a TypeScript-based engine for various small puzzle games. It could be used as a unit to power a
small game site, or you could use specific pieces for specific uses. (In fact, the main reason I'm developing this is to
help power puzzles in a larger game.)

## Development Prerequisites
